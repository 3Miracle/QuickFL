# QuickFL
This is the source repo for Infocom2025 paper "QuickFL: A QAT Aided Acceleration Framework for Communication and Computation Efficient Federated Learning"
# Structure
This includes the QAT hardware accelerated gradient homomorphic encryption and decryption C-project software stack(located in the "C-project src" folder), including the homomorphic encryption and decryption Python call interface in the compiled dynamic library **libhcs.so**, and includes an implementation of the federated learning Python call interface based on the Ctypes implementation(located in the Python API folder).Based on the compiled dynamic library libhcs.so combined with the Python API can be used directly out of the box, apply to other privacy computing frameworks that require homomorphic encryption and decryption.
